# Software Test Automation for Embedded Systems

### Overview
This repository contains all of my work for the **Software Test Automation for Embedded Systems (TX00EX88-3001)** course. The focus is on learning how to automate testing for embedded systems using the **Robot Framework**. Throughout this course, I’ll be working on various assignments and projects that demonstrate my understanding of test automation and how to apply it in embedded environments.

### Course Information
- **Course Code**: TX00EX88-3001
- **Instructor**: Keijo Länsikunnas
- **Dates**: 21.10.2024 - 15.12.2024

### What This Repository Contains
In this repo, you’ll find my assignment solutions:
- Each assignment builds on different aspects of automated testing, from writing test cases to interfacing with embedded devices.

### Topics Covered
- Installing and using the Robot Framework
- Writing and maintaining automated tests
- Creating and modifying custom test libraries
- Testing embedded systems
- Integrating automated testing with CI/CD pipelines

### Skills & Tools
This course assumes familiarity with:
- C/C++ programming
- Basic Python knowledge

I’ll be expanding my skills in these areas while learning how to use the Robot Framework to automate tests for embedded systems.

### Goals
By the end of this course, I aim to:
- Understand how to effectively automate tests for embedded systems.
- Develop reusable and maintainable test libraries.
- Integrate test automation into continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) workflows.
